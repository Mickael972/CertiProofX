# Contributing to CertiProof X

We love your input! We want to make contributing to CertiProof X as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Setting Up Development Environment

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/0xGenesis/certiproof-x.git
   cd certiproof-x
   ```

2. **Run setup script**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-dev.sh
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   - Edit `contracts/.env` with your API keys
   - Edit `backend/.env` with your IPFS credentials
   - Edit `frontend/.env` after contract deployment

4. **Start development**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/dev.sh
   ```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature
   ```

2. **Make your changes and commit**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add amazing feature"
   ```

3. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/test-all.sh
   ```

4. **Push to your fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/amazing-feature
   ```

5. **Create a Pull Request**
